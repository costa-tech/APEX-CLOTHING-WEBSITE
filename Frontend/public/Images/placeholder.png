This is a placeholder file marker. Since we can't create actual PNG files via text tools, please:
1. Create a simple placeholder image (400x400px)
2. Save it as: Frontend\public\images\placeholder.png
3. Or use any default product image you have

Alternatively, the code will gracefully handle missing images with the onError handler.
